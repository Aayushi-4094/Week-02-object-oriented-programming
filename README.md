# Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Welcome to **Week 2** of our Java learning journey. This week dives deep into the **core principles of Object-Oriented Programming**, a paradigm that is the foundation of Java. You'll learn how to model real-world entities using classes and objects, utilize constructors, implement inheritance and polymorphism, and understand the design principles behind OOP.

## Overview

This week focused on **object-oriented programming concepts** such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. You learned how Java implements OOP, how to design class diagrams, and how to use keywords like `this`, `static`, `final`, and `instanceof`.
